# Basic_Onshape_CAD
Here is the link to my Onshape Document: https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85889d326dbea32dc919ddd5/w/88155d67617acafe5cd29304/e/8565cf15d919ac147052f92b
My Reflection: I think that with a little practice Onshape will be a lot more efficient than Solidworks, and the fact that I am already understanding the material and
having fun with it makes me very hopeful for this year.
